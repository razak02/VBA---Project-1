The code summarizes by individual stock ticker, the total volume, the increase or decrease in price and the total volume. 
It also identifies the stock which has the highest increase and decrease and the volume with the corresponding values.

Files included are the screen shots of the different years 2014, 2015 and 2016 along with the code in visual basic. The source spreadsheet has not been included.
